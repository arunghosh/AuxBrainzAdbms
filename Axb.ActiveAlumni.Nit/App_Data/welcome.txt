<b>Ragam</b>, the annual inter-college student-organized fest, with guidance from faculty and alumni alike, conducted by National Institute of Technology, Calicut, is scheduled to be held from March 13-16 this year.

This is the 28th edition of Ragam since its inception in 1987. Ragam is conducted every year in remembrance of our beloved brother Shri P.Rajan, an alumnus of the erstwhile Regional Engineering College, Calicut and a renowned singer who went missing since March 1, 1976 after an alleged arrest. Although Ragam is conducted every year with much enthusiasm and festivity, the present generation, even the organisers of Ragam are ignorant of the history of Ragam and Shri. Rajan. 

In addition to the socio-cultural and literary events, pro-shows, workshops, exhibitions and other informal events, this year Ragam team is planning to conduct a special event, a memorial service on Shri Rajan.
 
The memoir is expected to have talks by the friends of Shri. Rajan, from the 1976-77 batch of the college (then REC). An exhibition of the news articles concerning the events leading to Rajan's death and after is also planned. The memoir will also screen videos of talks by the relatives from the family of Rajan which will give more insight into the life of Shri. Rajan. 

Parent chapter of Alumni association appeals to all RECCAAites / NITCAAites to be a part of RAGAM by your presence with family and contribute meaningfully in the success of RAGAM.
